## How VegBuddy Works

VegBuddy is powered by **IBM Cloud Watsonx Assistant**, a robust conversational AI platform. Our project configures a sophisticated dialogue flow that interprets user queries, processes intents related to food recommendations, recipes, and ordering, and provides relevant, helpful responses.
 
## Technologies Used

**IBM Cloud Watsonx Assistant:** The core conversational AI engine.                   
**Natural Language Processing (NLP):** For understanding user input.
**HTML/CSS:** for a web interface.

## Exploring VegBuddy

Since VegBuddy is primarily an IBM Cloud Watsonx Assistant project, direct "installation" is not applicable in the traditional sense. However, you can:

1.  **Explore the Watsonx Assistant Configuration:** If you have access to the IBM Cloud account where VegBuddy is hosted, you can delve into the Watsonx Assistant service to understand its intents, entities, and dialogue flows.
2.  **Interact with the Chatbot:** If VegBuddy is deployed on a web page or integrated into a platform, you can simply start chatting with it!
